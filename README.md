### 👾 The Game

Angry Birds (also known as Angry Birds Classic) was a 2009 physics-based casual puzzle video game developed by Finnish video game developer [Rovio Entertainment](https://www.rovio.com). In Angry Birds, the player controls a flock of multi-colored birds that are attempting to save their eggs from green-colored pigs.
